                    Hey Fam! 
                    
                    I went to dinner the other night with a friend and both of us were craving Pho so, we went to Hanoi on King. This is a fairly recent discovery of mine and itâ€™s super underrated so try to get there before all the hipsters find out ðŸ˜‚.
                    
                    <br> My ratings go from 0-10 with 10 being an exact replica of my favourite Pho in Ho Chi Minh (Phá»Ÿ PhÃº VÆ°Æ¡ng). For me itâ€™s all about the broth. I want it to be more towards the savoury side, if the broth is sweet then straight up, I wonâ€™t like it. 
                    </br>
        
                   <br> The Pho at Hanoi on King is a solid <b>7.5/10</b> 
                </br>

                        <li> <i>Heavier ginger flavour</i></li>
                        <p>This does slightly take the beefiness away but I like it as it cleanses your palate 
                        </p>
                        <li><i>Condiments</i>
                        </li>
                        <p>Not only do they give you the bean sprouts etc but thereâ€™s also some spicy pickled radish, pickled garlic and fermented shrimp paste that you could add to your bowl. The pickled radish was the winner for me.
                        </p>
                        <li><i>Brisket</i></li>
                        <p>Perfect balance between lean/fattiness.</p>
                        <li><i>Portion</i>
                        </li>
                        <p>Perfect size for 1 person. I hate seeing it go to waste. </p>
                        <li><i>Price</i></li>
                        <p>This bowl was super affordable ($12.50 for Regular).</p>

                        <p>Got soggy too quickly. It breaks my heart when this happens because it really does affect every bite ðŸ˜”.</p>
                        <li><i>Sliced</i></li>
                        <p>I wish they were thin long slices. Itâ€™s just how they had it in Vietnam (and better that way).</p>

                        Anyways, let me know if you do give this place a go! 
                
                        <br> P.s their vegetarian spring rolls are deffs an 8/10. I just didnâ€™t like how they cut them in Â½  and they didnâ€™t give you enough lettuce, mint and pickled carrots to wrap it in. Also, my mum makes the best ones so thatâ€™s what Iâ€™m comparing them to. </br>
